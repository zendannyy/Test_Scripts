## Adding new features

If you're interested in adding new features or fixing issues to the `freq` project, the overall process is:

1. Select an issue to work on and assign the issue to yourself.  If not already created, first create the issue.
2. Fork the project.
3. Make the changes, including any additional test cases that should be added.
4. Create a Pull Request against the `master` branch of this repo.
5. After a review of the PR, make any changes as requested by the reviewer.
6. The PR will then be merged into the repo.

Donâ€™t get discouraged! We estimate that the response time from the maintainers is around a few days.

## Bug Triage

We welcome the reporting of issues and do so by using the [integrated Github issues](https://github.com/MarkBaggett/freq/issues).  When creating a new issue, you can help us diagnose and fix existing bugs by asking and providing answers for the following:

* Is the bug reproducible as explained?
* Is it reproducible in other environments (for instance, different versions of python, or different operating systems)?
* Are the steps to reproduce the bug clear? If not, can you describe how you might reproduce it?
* What tags should the bug have?

## Documentation

If you're interested in working on the documentation for the project, feel free to do so as well.  The same process for adding new features goes for adding documentation.
